          <p>Stuff's hard with covid but I am developing game. Very fun. Definitley... This project is, first of all, a total experiment so no judge! Unfortunatley, I do have to redo most of my game because unity glitched out. YES, I am using unity as you know, but I had to because of the VR framework for Oculus. Also sorry for not making it work for all headsets, if I had done that it would not have worked as well for Oculus Standalone. Also at the time of this, I do not make any money from my game. Just FYI. ALSO, it's the 1 year anniversary of Half-Life: Alyx! fun fact i guess?</p>

        <p>Announcement! slice360 is no longer the name of that game i was making because i liked the name so much that i will name my studio that (not officially, every game is under my pseudoname) but it's a nice name and i wil start making more games hopefully with unreal engine and source 2 and also non-vr games.</p>
