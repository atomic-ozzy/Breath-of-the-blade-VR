          <p>Stuff's hard with covid but I am developing game. Very fun. Definitley... This project is, first of all, a total experiment so no judge! Unfortunatley, I do have to redo most of my game because unity glitched out. YES, I am using unity as you know, but I had to because of the VR framework for Oculus. Also sorry for not making it work for all headsets, if I had done that it would not have worked as well for Oculus Standalone. Also at the time of this, I do not make any money from my game. Just FYI. ALSO, it's the 1 year anniversary of Half:Life Alyx! fun fact i guess?</p>
